# Microbiome Analysis and Visualization
R analysis Script for Visualizing Pre-processed 16s, 18s, and ITS Phyloseq Objects


The 16s raw reads are preprocessed and Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) (popularly known as Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs)) generated using the [16s master script](https://github.com/NOngeso/Microbiome_Visualization/blob/main/scripts/master_16s_Analysis.R).

I further developed an [R script](https://github.com/NOngeso/Microbiome_Visualization/blob/main/scripts/Manipulating_Phyloseq_Object.Rmd) for phyloseq object manipulation and visualizing high quality images for publication.
